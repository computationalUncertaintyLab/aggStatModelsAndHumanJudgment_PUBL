1,1,1/6/21,1/16/21,What will be the number of new incident U.S. adult and pediatric previous day admissions to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 for the week beginning on 2021-01-24 and ending on 2021-01-30 (inclusive)?,"This question will resolve as the total number of adult plus pediatric previous day admissions with confirmed COVID-19 as recorded in the Department of Health and Human Service’s report of COVID-19 reported patient impact and hospital capacity. The total previous day admissions is computed using two variables in this report: previous_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed and previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed. This report, and the resolution criteria, includes data on all 50 US states, Washington DC, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands (53 states and territories). The report will be accessed one week after the end of the month (2021-02-06)."
1,2,1/6/21,1/16/21,What will be the total number of new incident deaths due to COVID-19 in the US for the week beginning on 2021-01-24 and ending on 2021-01-30 (inclusive)?,This question will resolve as the number of new deaths due to confirmed COVID-19 for the week beginning on 2021-01-24 and ending on 2021-01-30 (inclusive) as recorded in the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) CSSE Github data repository. This file records the daily number of deaths by county. From this file deaths are summed across all counties and aggregated by week to generate the number of new deaths per week. The report will be accessed one week after the end of the month (2021-02-06).
1,3,1/6/21,1/16/21,What will be the number of new incident confirmed positive COVID-19 cases in the US beginning on 2021-01-24 and ending on 2021-01-30 (inclusive)?,This question will resolve as the number of new confirmed cases beginning on 2021-01-24 and ending on 2021-01-30 (inclusive) recorded in the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) CSSE Github data repository. This file records the daily number of cases by county. From this file cases are summed across all counties and aggregated by week to generate the number of new cases per week. The report will be accessed one week after the end of the month (2021-02-06).
1,4,1/6/21,1/16/21,What factor should the median 4-week-ahead COVIDhub Ensemble forecast of national incident deaths made on 4 Jan(a forecast for the 24-30 Jan week) be multiplied by so that it equals the reported number of new US incident deaths?,This question will resolve as the factor that the The COVID-19 Forecast Hub's “COVIDhub” Ensemble median forecast of the US national number of incident deaths 4 weeks into the future should be multiplied by (the reported number of incident deaths divided by the forecasted median) to equal the reported number of US national incident deaths as reported by the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) CSSE Github data repository.
1,5,1/6/21,1/16/21,What will be the cumulative number of deaths due to COVID-19 on 2021-12-31 if less than 50% of Americans initiate vaccination (1st dose received) with a COVID-19 vaccine by 2021-03-01?,"The percent of the population that received a COVID-19 vaccine on or before 2021-03-01 will be computed by dividing the number of individuals who have initiated vaccine (1st dose taken) provided by the CDC COVID data tracker by the current US population which on 2021-01-04 was reported to be 330,782,991 and multiplying this fraction by 100. The CDC COVID data tracker that counts the number of individuals who have initialized vaccination will be accessed when data is available after and as close as possible to 2021-03-01. To resolve deaths, we will use the cumulative number of deaths due to confirmed COVID-19 as recorded in the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) CSSE Github data repository. This file records the daily number of deaths by county. From this file deaths are summed across all counties and aggregated to week to generate the number of new deaths per week. The report will be accessed one week after 2021-12-31. 9 January edit: This question will resolve ambiguously if greater than or equal to 50% of Americans are vaccinated by 2021-03-01."
1,6,1/6/21,1/16/21,What will be the cumulative number of deaths due to COVID-19 on 2021-12-31 if greater than or equal to 50% of Americans initiate vaccination (1st dose received) with a COVID-19 vaccine by 2021-03-01?,"The percent of the population that received a COVID-19 vaccine on or before 2021-03-01 will be computed by dividing the number of individuals who have initiated vaccine (1st dose taken) provided by the CDC COVID data tracker by the current US population which on 2021-01-04 was reported to be 330,782,991 and multiplying this fraction by 100.

1,7,1/6/21,1/16/21,What will be the percent of B.1.1.7 among all S gene dropout SARS-CoV-2 samples submitted for genomic sequencing surveillance in the US between 2021-02-01 and 2021-02-15?,"This NextStrain page on S:N501Y as a proportion of overall S gene dropout samples in the US will be consulted for resolution. To access this data, scroll to the bottom of the page and download “selected metadata.” In this Excel sheet, please consult the “Pangolin Lineage” column to find B.1.1.7 samples. Samples that have a “collection data” date between 2021-02-01 and 2021-02-15 (inclusive) will be considered. We will compute the proportion by dividing the number of B.1.1.7 samples by the total number of samples (which are all 69del samples) in the spreadsheet. NextStrain will be accessed in the last week of February (the week ending on 2021-02-27) for resolution."
