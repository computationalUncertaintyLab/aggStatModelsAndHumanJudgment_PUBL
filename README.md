# Aggregating statistical models and human judgment

## Project Aim
This project aims to provide public health officials metaforecasts---a combination of probabilistic predictions from computational models, subject matter experts, and trained forecasters---of the COVID-19 outbreak, and an expert consensus of the most effective interventions to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and impact of COVID-19.  

Available at this repository are metaforecasts of the COVID-19 outbreak and consensuses on effective interventions sent to the public and public health officials. This repository also contains software used to aggregate predictions.

Human judgment has the potential to reduce the burden of COVID-19 on the US in two ways. Predictions from experts and trained forecasters combine objective data, available to computational models, and unstructured information, only available to humans, that allows public health officials access to a broader pool of data about the virus. Most computational models make passive forecasts of a set of agreed upon targets. In addition to passive forecasts, humans can make active forecasts of potentially effective interventions to guide public health strategy, policy, and decision making.
