# Aggregating statistical models and human judgment

## Project Aim
This project aims to provide public health officials metaforecasts---a combination of probabilistic predictions from computational models, subject matter experts, and trained forecasters---of the COVID-19 outbreak, and an expert consensus of the most effective interventions to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and impact of COVID-19.  

Available at this repository are metaforecasts of the COVID-19 outbreak and consensuses on effective interventions sent to the public and public health officials. This repository also contains software used to aggregate predictions.

Human judgment has the potential to reduce the COVID-19 burden on the US in two ways. Predictions from experts and trained forecasters combine objective data, available to computational models, and unstructured data, only available to humans, allowing public health officials access to a broader pool of data on the virus. Most computational models are restricted to making passive forecasts, predictions of an evolving target through time, but humans can make active forecasts of possibly effective interventions to guide public health strategy, policy, and decision making.
